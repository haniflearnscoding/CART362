# Process Journal - SIMS

## 25/02/24
Ok about one week out from the submission of this project, thought having some form of documentation might help inform how I wish to approach the remaining time I have for this project. Below will be a few renders I will do just to get an idea of what I have going.

Following a specific tutorial for this using Sapling Tree Gen. Something about having the armature visible is interesting to me. I don't know if this is something I'll keep.  

Going for a relaxed/meditative feeling with this sequence render? I think? Most likely a static shot into a zoom? Kinda like the angle I have rn.
