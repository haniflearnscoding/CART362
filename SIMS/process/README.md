# Process Journal - SIMS

## 25/02/25
Ok about one week out from the submission of this project, thought having some form of documentation might help inform how I wish to approach the remaining time I have for this project. Below will be a few renders I will do just to get an idea of what I have going.

Following a specific tutorial for this using Sapling Tree Gen. Something about having the armature visible is interesting to me. I don't know if this is something I'll keep.  

Going for a relaxed/meditative feeling with this sequence render? I think? Most likely a static shot into a zoom? Kinda like the angle I have rn.

Ok here is an update.

Some thoughts. Working in with nodes in the shader editor is a lot of fun. I've gotten the tree to look the way I want to. If I do change my mind it would be pretty eazy to mess around with the parameters I already have. More thoughts on shade editor later. 

I think now I'm at a crossroad where the way I decide to approach this project will dictate the overall feel I want to go for. Just not sure what I want to go for either. 

Most environments would have a patch of grass with different types of flowers scattered around. And a calming blue sky with a few clouds. Although initially I was leaning towards this, I think I want some friction between how calming the tree is and its environment. I could do some research into different types of plants and flowers I can scatter in the environment that could better express this feeling. Maybe not even a blue sky then. I liked the white sky from when I first started the tree. A lot of room for exploration.
